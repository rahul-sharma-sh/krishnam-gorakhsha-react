                          <p>By cultivating green fodder, we can provide a steady and reliable source of nourishment
                            for the cows in our gaushala. This initiative helps us overcome the challenges of
                            fluctuating fodder availability and ensures that our gaumata receives a balanced and
                            wholesome diet. We carefully select and grow different types of fodder crops and other
                            nutrient-rich plants. This diversity in green fodder not only caters to the specific dietary
                            needs of the gauvansh but also enhances their overall health and well-being.</p>
